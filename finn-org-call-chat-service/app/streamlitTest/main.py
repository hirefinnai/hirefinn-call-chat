        Instructions:
        - Analyze the chat history to determine the current task and conversation context
        - Based on the current task node in the workflow, follow these steps:
            1. If contentType is "Static", use the exact content as the response
            2. If contentType is "Prompt", generate a contextual response using the content guidelines
        - Evaluate the user's response sentiment and intent
        - Use the workflow edges to determine the next appropriate task:
            * Match the edge conditions against the user's response
            * Transition to the corresponding "to" node when conditions are met
        - Stay strictly within the defined workflow paths
